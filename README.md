    	 Invaluable tutorials on OpenGL, and 99.9% of our Texture class.

  - Daniel Beard, Paul Boxley and Paul Martz:
    	   Information and code for generating random terrain.
	   The code we eventually implemented is heavily modified
	   from Daniel Beard's implementation, using Boxley and Martz's 
	   writeups as guidelines.

Outdated HSC Readme

- This is our Graphics I final project for Prof. Grinstein,
  at UMass Lowell, Fall 2012.

- It has been written ground-up without utilizing the fixed-pipeline
  API of OpenGL. 

- It implements a fully Object-Oriented scene graph, independent and
  arbitrary cameras (realized via splitscreen), and multiple methods
  of input.

- The project features prominently random terrain generation. This is
  performed using the Diamond-Square algorithm; see below for additional
  reading on the technique.

- This project utilizes a lot of code snippets, libraries and ideas from
  a variety of authors. They are credited above!

- To build the project, pushd Flythrough && make;
  To run, pushd Flythrough && ./fly;

- Controls (as of Mon 03 Dec 2012)
  w,a,s,d: Forward, back, strafe left and right (As in most commercial FPS games)
  q,e: Fly up, Fly down.
  mouse: Look around.
  click and move mouse: Rotate left or right.
  right-click: Open a menu that allows you to toggle mouselook between fixed-y and free-y rotations.

  z,x,c,v,b: Various perspective modes;
  	     z: Perspective
	     x: Ortho2D
	     b: Identity

  l: Generate new terrain.

  +,-: Add or remove cameras.

  left,right: Cycle between the active scene objects.

  F1,F2,F3,F4: Change the rendering mode of the active scene object.
  	       F1: GL_POINTS
	       F2: GL_LINE_LOOP
	       F3: GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
	       F4: GL_TRIANGLES

  Wiimote Minus Button: Enable/Calibrate Gyroscope
  Keyboard '~':         Calibrate Gyroscope, Reset Camera.

  Wiimote Balance Board Button: Begin Tare (Calibrate to Zero.)

  with minor alterations.
